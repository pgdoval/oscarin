## OSCArIn
Open-Source Chess Artificial Intelligence

### Motivation
The idea of OSCArIn is to create a simple artificial intelligence for chess, showing some of
the ideas that I always thought would be interesting in a program of these characteristics.
Also, it's written in Java to boost understandability and explainability.
